# A program
--> Is made of statement
--> as a book is to sentences

# Statement in JS
* Can be separated by lines i.e
stamenent0
statement1

* Can be separated by commas i.e
statement0; statement1;

* A good practice
statement0;
statement1;

# Comments
--> can be done // single line.
--> can be done /* stuff here for block comments*/

# Variable
--> giving a piece of data a name so that we can refer to it later on in the program just by name. i.e
var chameleon; // we declare
chameleon = "blue"; // we assign a value

--> variable names can contain letters and numbers, apart from the '$' and '_'
--> var are case sensitive
--> strictly typed vs loosely typed variables.

## Variable and Data types
--> In JS there are:
*Booleans
*Strings
*Objects
* Lists/Arrays
*Numbers

## 1. Numbers
var whole = 3 // int
var decimal = 3.14 //float or floating point numbers

--> With numbers come 'Operators'
e.g +*/-
--> If you combine integers and float operations, the result wil always be a floating
// Shorthand operation methods
var age = age + 1
age += 1
age ++ // as long as it is an increament of 1

## Strings
var single = 'just a single quote';
var double = "Just a double quote";

--> Escaping
var thisEscaping = 'We escape using the \'Backslash\' always.

--> Booleans
can be either true or false
var lying = false;
var truthy = true;

## Arrays
--> Number, strings and Booleans store individual data
--> Arrays store a group of different peices of Data
var rack = [] // This is empty, i.e has no elements
rack[0] // referencing the 1st index in the list

--> Arrays within an array // multi-dimensional arrays.
--> finding out the number of elements in an arrays // We use length
rack.length
rack.length -1 // gives us the last element index value

## Associative Arrays. (Dictionaries)
var postcodes = []
postcodes["Armadale"] = 3123  // the key is in string form. The value can be anything.
